# Student Score Prediction
## Project Overview
For this research, I'll be analyzing grades and study hours data for students. Building a prediction model that can determine students' grades based on their study hours is the primary goal of this analysis.
## Data Overview
> Hours: Number of hours studied by a student.
> Scores: Score obtained by the student. The dataset is consistent, with no missing values or duplicates, and shows a positive correlation between study hours and scores.
## Tools Used
> Visual Studio Code
> Microsoft Excel
## Languages
> Python
## Conclusion
Linear Regression: Offers reliable and consistent forecasts and is better suited for a linear association between study hours and scores.
## Recomendation
1. In this instance, use linear regression to make effective forecasts.
2. To boost the Decision Tree's efficiency, adjust its hyperparameters.
3. To guarantee consistent model performance and prevent overfitting, apply cross-validation.
